 Hi Lisa! My name is John, and I hope you’re having a great day. I was just looking at my bill and noticed a charge I didn't expect. Could you help me out with that?

00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:31,225
 Hi John! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'd be happy to help you with your bill. Can I please have your account number or service ID?

00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:35,437
 Sure, it’s 123456.

00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:44,312
 Thank you, John. Let me pull up your account. While I do that, could you tell me which charge you’re referring to?  

6
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:50,200
 It's a $15 charge listed as "additional services" on my latest statement.  

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:01:01,575
 I see the charge you're talking about. Let me explain that for you. This charge is for an international call you made last month. Does that ring a bell?  

8
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:07,900
 Oh, yes, I remember now! Thanks for clearing that up, Lisa.  

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,987
 No problem at all, John. Is there anything else I can help you with today?  

10
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:20,325
 Nope, that’s all. You’ve been great. Thanks again!
