 Good morning, you’ve reached XYZ Telecom. My name is Lisa. How can I assist you today?  

2
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:14,450
 I’ve been trying to set up new internet service for days, and I keep getting the runaround!  

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:26,825
 I’m really sorry to hear that, and I can understand how frustrating that must be. Let’s get this sorted out for you right away. May I have your name and contact information, please?  

4
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:33,687
 It’s Jane Smith, 555-987-6543.  

5
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:40,062
 Thank you, Jane. And what is the address where you’d like to set up the new service?  

6
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:43,750
 456 Oak Avenue.  

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:54,212
 Got it. Can you tell me a little more about the services you’re looking for? Are you interested in internet, phone, TV, or a combination?  

8
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:57,825
 Just internet, and I need it fast!  

9
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:07,812
 Absolutely, Jane. We have several high-speed internet plans available. Let me check if we can provide service to your address.  

10
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:10,050
 Fine.  

11
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:23,600
 I’ve confirmed that we can offer high-speed internet at 456 Oak Avenue. We have a plan offering speeds up to 500 Mbps for $50 per month. Would that work for you?  

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,662
 Yes, that’s fine. Just get it done.  

13
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:37,037
 Understood. I’ll process your order now. Do you need any additional equipment, or are you all set?  

14
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:43,037
 I have everything I need. Just get someone out here to install it.  

15
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:51,300
 I’ll schedule the earliest available installation appointment. How does tomorrow between 2 PM and 4 PM sound?  

16
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,562
 Finally! That works.  

17
00:01:55,562 --> 00:02:08,975
 Great, Jane. Your installation is scheduled for tomorrow between 2 PM and 4 PM. You’ll receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?  

18
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:12,512
 No, just make sure they show up.  

19
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:23,725
 We’ll be there, Jane. Thank you for choosing XYZ Telecom, and I apologize for any inconvenience you’ve experienced. Have a better day!
