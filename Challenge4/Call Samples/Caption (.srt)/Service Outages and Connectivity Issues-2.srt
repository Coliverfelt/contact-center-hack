 Thank you for that information. Let me check if there’s a known outage in your area.  There are no outages reported. Let’s try some troubleshooting steps. Can you restart your modem and router?

00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:07,875
 I’ve done that already, multiple times!

10
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:15,187
 I appreciate your patience. Can you check if all cables are securely connected and undamaged?

00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:18,450
 Yes, they are fine.

12
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,225
 Alright, let’s check the lights on your modem/router. Are they all on and stable?

13
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:28,225
 Yes, they are.

14
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:34,837
 Thank you. Let’s see if other devices in your house are also facing the same issue.

 Yes, everything is affected.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:59,650
