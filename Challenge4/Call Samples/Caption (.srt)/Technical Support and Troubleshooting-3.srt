 Good afternoon! Thank you for calling XYZ Telecommunications. My name is Lisa. How can I assist you today?  

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,387
 My TV service is down, and I’m really annoyed! It’s been like this for hours! 

3
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:28,400
I’m very sorry for the inconvenience, and I understand how upsetting that can be. Let’s get this fixed for you. Can I please have your name and account number?  

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,812
 It’s John, and my account number is 654321.  

5
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:46,425
 Thank you, Lisa. I’ll need a bit more information to help you better. How long have you been experiencing this issue, and have you made any recent changes to your equipment or service plan?  

6
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:51,662
 It started this morning, and no, I haven’t changed anything.  

7
00:00:51,662 --> 00:01:01,762
 I appreciate the details. Let’s start by ensuring both your TV and set-top box are powered on. Could you please check that for me?  

8
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:05,062
 Yes, they’re both on.  

9
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:14,525
 Great. Now, let’s try resetting your set-top box. I’ll guide you through the steps. Are you ready?  

10
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:17,725
 Yes, go ahead.  

11
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:26,387
 Please press and hold the reset button on your set-top box for 10 seconds, then release it. Let’s wait for it to reboot.  

12
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,587
 Okay, it’s rebooting.  

13
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:35,700
 Excellent. Once it’s back on, could you check if the issue persists?  

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,050
 It’s working now! Thank you so much, Lisa!  

15
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:53,550
 I’m glad we could get it sorted out! If you have any more issues, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  

16
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,187
 No, that’s all. Thanks again!  

17
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:03,362
 You’re very welcome, John! Have a wonderful day!
