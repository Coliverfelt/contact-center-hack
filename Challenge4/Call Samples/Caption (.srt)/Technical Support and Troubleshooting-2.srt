00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:14,675
 My internet has been down for hours! I’m really frustrated!

 It’s John, and my account number is 789012.

5
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:46,650
 Thank you, John. I’ll also need a bit more information to help you better. How long has this issue been going on, and have you made any recent changes to your equipment or service plan?

6
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,975
 It started this morning, and no, nothing’s changed.

7
00:00:50,975 --> 00:01:12,825
 I appreciate the information. Let’s start by checking if there are any known outages in your area. Please hold for a moment.  John, it seems there are no known outages. Let’s proceed with some troubleshooting steps. Could you please restart your modem and router?

8
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:16,662
 I’ve done that already, and it didn’t help!

9
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:25,487
 I understand your frustration. Let’s try checking the modem and router lights. Are they all on and green?

10
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:29,912
 The power light is green, but the internet light is off.

11
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:40,312
 Thank you for that information. It seems like there might be an issue with the connection. Can you please check if any cables are loose or damaged?

12
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:43,275
 All cables seem fine.

13
00:01:43,275 --> 00:02:05,900
 I see. Let me run a remote diagnostic to get more details. Please hold for a moment.  John, our diagnostics indicate a possible issue with the line. I’ll need to escalate this to our technical team. I’ll create a trouble ticket and provide you with the ticket number.

14
