 Good morning! Thank you for calling XYZ Telecom. My name is Lisa. How can I assist you today?  

2
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:17,550
 Hi! I’m interested in setting up a new internet and TV service at my home. Can you help me with that?  

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,750
 Absolutely, I'd be delighted to help you with that. May I please have your name and contact information to get started?  

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:33,450
 Sure, my name is John Doe, and my number is 555-123-4567.  

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,287
 Thank you, John. And what is the service address where you’d like to set up the new services?  

6
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:44,000
 It’s 123 Maple Street.  

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,512
 Great, thank you! Now, could you tell me a bit more about what you’re looking for in your internet and TV services? Do you have any specific requirements or preferences?  

8
00:00:55,512 --> 00:01:02,062
 I’m looking for high-speed internet and a good selection of TV channels, especially sports channels.  

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:20,487
 Perfect, we have several plans that might be a great fit for you. For high-speed internet, we offer speeds up to 1 Gbps. For TV, we have a package that includes all the major sports channels. Let me check if these services are available at your address.  

10
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:23,050
 That sounds good!  

11
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:40,437
 Wonderful! I’ve checked, and both our high-speed internet and comprehensive TV package are available at your address. The internet plan costs $60 per month, and the TV package is $80 per month. Would you like to proceed with these options?  

12
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:43,637
 Yes, that works for me.  

13
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:54,125
 Excellent choice! I’ll process your order now. Could you please confirm if you need any additional equipment or if you’ll be porting your current phone number?  

14
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:59,050
 No additional equipment needed, and I don’t need to port a phone number.  

15
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:07,625
 Great! The next step is to schedule an installation appointment. When would be a convenient time for you?  

16
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,375
 How about this Friday?  

17
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:19,587
 Let me check... Yes, we have an opening this Friday between 10 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?  

18
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,762
 Yes, that’s perfect.  

19
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:37,375
 Fantastic! I’ve scheduled your installation for this Friday between 10 AM and 12 PM. You’ll receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  

20
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:42,262
 No, that’s all. Thank you so much!  

21
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:50,337
 You’re very welcome, John! Thank you for choosing XYZ Telecom. Have a great day!
