 Thank you for calling XYZ Telecom. My name is Lisa. How can I assist you today?  

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:18,262
 Yeah, hi. I'm pretty annoyed with you guys right now. I was overcharged on my last bill, and I want it fixed immediately.  

3
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:28,875
 I’m really sorry to hear that you’re upset. Let’s get this sorted out for you. May I have your account number or service ID, please?  

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:34,212
 It’s 987654.  

5
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:40,375
 Thank you. Can you please tell me more about the charge you believe is incorrect?  

6
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:47,387
 It's a $50 charge for something I didn’t authorize. This is unacceptable!  

7
00:00:47,387 --> 00:01:02,575
 I understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. This $50 charge appears to be for a premium service subscription. Did you or anyone else in your household sign up for this service?  

8
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,575
 No, we did not!  

9
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:18,375
 I apologize for the inconvenience. I will remove this charge from your account and issue a refund. You should see the adjustment within the next 3-5 business days.  

10
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:22,525
 Fine, just make sure it doesn’t happen again.  

11
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:28,125
 I assure you it won’t. Is there anything else I can help you with today?  

12
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,912
 No, that's it.  

13
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:36,400
 Thank you for calling XYZ Telecom. Have a good day.
