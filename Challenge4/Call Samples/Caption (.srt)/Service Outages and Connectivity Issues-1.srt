Good morning! Thank you for calling our support center. My name is Lisa. How can I help you today?

00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:19,162
Hi Lisa! My name is John and I’ve been having some trouble with my internet connection for the past few hours. Can you help me out?

3
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:31,887
Of course, John! I’m really sorry for the inconvenience. Let’s get this sorted out for you. Can I please have your account number or service ID to get started?

4
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:36,275
Sure, it’s 12345678.

5
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:44,687
Great, thank you. Can you describe the issue you’re experiencing? Are there any error messages?

6
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:51,537
The internet just keeps dropping every few minutes. No specific error messages though.

7
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:56,850
I see. How long has this been happening, John?

8
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,762
It started this morning.

9
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:06,837
Thanks for that information. Let me quickly check if there is a known outage in your area.

10
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:17,212
It looks like there aren’t any reported outages. Let’s try some troubleshooting steps. Can you first try restarting your modem and router?

11
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:20,137
Sure, one second.

12
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:23,425
Okay, I’ve restarted them.

13
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:29,437
Perfect. Are all the cables securely connected and undamaged?

14
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:32,650
Yes, everything looks fine.

15
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:39,762
Alright, let’s check the lights on your modem/router. Are they all on and stable?

16
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:43,124
Yes, they’re all on and stable.

17
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:50,924
Great! Can you check if other devices in your house are also experiencing connectivity issues?

18
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:55,074
Yes, they all seem to be having the same problem.

19
00:01:55,074 --> 00:02:03,724
Thank you for checking that. Since the basic steps haven’t resolved the issue, I’ll perform remote diagnostics.

20
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:19,962
It appears there’s an issue on our end. I’ll escalate this to our technical team. Here’s your trouble ticket number, 987654321. We’ll work on resolving this and provide an update soon.

21
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:25,011
Thank you, Lisa. You’ve been really helpful!

22
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:33,136
My pleasure, John. We’ll get this fixed as soon as possible. Have a wonderful day!
