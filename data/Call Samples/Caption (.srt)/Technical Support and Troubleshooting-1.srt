00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:18,312
Hi Lisa! I'm having some trouble with my internet connection. It keeps cutting out.

3
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:27,912
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Let's get this sorted out for you. May I have your name and account number to get started?

4
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:33,687
Sure, my name is Shawn, and my account number is 123456.

5
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:47,150
Thank you, Shawn. I’ll also need a bit more information to help you better. How long have you been experiencing this issue, and have you made any recent changes to your equipment or service plan?

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,425
It started yesterday, and no, I haven’t changed anything recently.

7
00:00:52,425 --> 00:01:03,950
Got it. Let’s start with some basic troubleshooting steps. Could you please restart your modem and router? I'll hold the line while you do that.

8
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:11,662
Alright, give me a minute.  Okay, I’ve restarted them.

9
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:18,737
Great. Now, can you check if all the lights on the modem and router are on and green?

10
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,412
Yes, they are.

11
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:28,287
Perfect. Are you still experiencing the connectivity issue on all your devices?

12
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:32,074
No, it seems to be working fine now!

13
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:42,637
That’s wonderful to hear! If you encounter any more issues, don’t hesitate to call us back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

14
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:47,349
Nope, that’s all. Thanks, Lisa!

15
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:52,287
You’re welcome, Shawn! Have a great day!
