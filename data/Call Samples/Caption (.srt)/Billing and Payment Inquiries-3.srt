Thank you for calling XYZ Telecom. My name is Lisa. How can I assist you today?

00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:15,775
This is ridiculous! I’ve been overcharged by $100, and I need this fixed now!

3
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:29,525
I’m really sorry to hear that you’re experiencing this, and I understand how frustrating it can be. Let’s get this resolved for you. Can you please provide your account number or service ID?

4
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:37,387
It’s 654321. I can’t believe this is happening.

5
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:45,887
Thank you. I’m pulling up your account now. Can you tell me more about the $100 charge you’re referring to?

6
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:52,637
It’s listed as “data overage” for last month. I didn’t use that much data!

7
00:00:52,637 --> 00:01:10,712
I understand your concern. Let me take a closer look at your usage details. I see there was a significant spike in data usage last month. It might be due to a software update or streaming. Are you aware of any such activity?

8
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:17,187
Oh, wait, I did download a couple of large updates. That must be it.

9
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:33,050
That makes sense. To help avoid this in the future, we can set up a data usage alert for you. Additionally, I can offer you a one-time courtesy credit of $50 to help with this unexpected charge. How does that sound?

10
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,625
That would be great, thank you. I appreciate your help.

11
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:46,587
You’re welcome! I’ve applied the credit to your account. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

12
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:53,862
No, that’s all. Thanks again, Lisa. You’ve been really helpful.

13
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:58,537
I’m glad I could help. Have a wonderful day!
