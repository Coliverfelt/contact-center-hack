 Hello, and thank you for calling XYZ Telecom. This is Lisa. How can I assist you?  

2
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,262
 I’m really frustrated with my current plan and need to change it now!  

3
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:23,125
 I’m very sorry to hear that you’re having issues. I’m here to help. May I have your name and account number to access your account details?  

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:29,125
 It’s John Smith, account number 7891011. 

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:36,662
Thank you, John. To verify, could you please confirm the last four digits of your phone number?  

6
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:42,800
 It’s 1234. Can we hurry this up?  

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:54,762
 Absolutely, John. I appreciate your patience. I see you’re on our Standard Plan. Could you tell me what’s causing the frustration so I can better assist you? 

8
00:00:54,762 --> 00:01:02,150
 I keep running out of data, and I’m being charged extra every month. It’s ridiculous! 

9
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:18,400
I understand how that could be very frustrating. Let’s look at some options to increase your data allowance and eliminate those extra charges. We have a Plus Plan that offers 15GB of data and an Unlimited Plan that might better suit your needs.  

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,075
I just want something that works without these stupid overages. 

11
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:34,237
I hear you, John. Our Unlimited Plan would ensure you never run out of data, and it’s only $30 more per month. Would you like to go ahead with this?  

12
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:37,212
Fine, just do it.  

13
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:50,112
Okay, I’ll process that change for you right now. The upgrade will take effect immediately, and you might need to restart your device to see the changes. You’ll see the new charges on your next bill.  

14
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:53,037
 Alright, thanks.  

15
00:01:53,037 --> 00:02:02,812
 You’re welcome, John. I’ll also send you a confirmation email with all the details. Is there anything else I can assist you with?  

16
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,937
 No, just get it done.  

17
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:13,925
 Of course. Thank you for your patience, and I hope this resolves your issue. Have a great day.
